## Quick Start Guide

In this guide, you'll have your application based on a semantic search service up and running on your computer. To do this, 
we will need to have the eLLMental library and create our services to consume this library:

To begin working locally with **eLLMental**, you'll need to clone the repository:

> git clone https://github.com/theam/ellmental.py

After that, we can follow the quick start guide to use the default configuration or create our own configuration.
