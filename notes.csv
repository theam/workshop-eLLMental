"eLLMental is an Open-Source toolkit built in Java that eases Production-Ready AI Development by providing native interfaces to popular AI APIs and models."
"Semantic Search Components - Semantic search is a game-changer for understanding context and retrieving information with accuracy. Our library offers three ready-to-use components that empower you to add Semantic Search features to your application in just a minute."
"Vector Store* - Use embedding databases without having to learn the specifics of their APIs."
"Embeddings Model* - Generates embeddings from raw text."
"Semantic Search Module - Combines the Vector Store and Embeddings Model components into a higher-level interface. Forget about dealing with implementation details. We’ve reduced the whole experience to only two methods, one that “learns”, another that “searches”, so you can focus on building your application."
"Embedding models are a special kind of Large Language Models (LLMs) that allow, given a piece of text, to calculate a large vector that represents a point in what we call the embeddings space. This embeddings space has the property that two pieces of text that are semantically related will be placed close to each other, allowing us to calculate a semantic distance between any two given pieces of text. Embeddings can be used to implement powerful search features that go beyond keyword matching, find related documents in a large database, or detect redundant information even when it's written in different ways."
"eLLMental uses different 3rd party components and APIs and provides a unified interface. To ensure extensibility and avoid tight coupling with any specific API, the library provides a series of abstract classes that define the expected interface for these components to work with eLLMental. To use eLLMental, you can provide your own implementation or use one of the built-in concrete implementations."
"eLLMental provides an implementation to use OpenAI's embeddings model. This model is only accessible via API, so you'll need to initialize it with a valid OpenAI API key."
"The OpenAI embeddings generator will automatically include the original text, the timestamp and the model used to generate the embedding in the metadata."
"The EmbeddingsSpaceComponent represents an embeddings space, facilitating the management and operations within it. Think of embeddings as a numeric representation of the meaning behind the text. Similar to how coordinates help pinpoint locations on Earth, in the embeddings space, semantically similar concepts cluster closer together. Before diving in, make sure to follow the Getting Started Guide to install the library in your project. It'd also be advisable to familiarize yourself with the core abstractions."
"Leveraging the power of embeddings models, this component allows you to represent pieces of text in an embeddings space. Once you generate an embedding, it's stored using an embeddings database, along with its metadata for efficient retrieval."
"Booster is an open-source minimalistic TypeScript framework to build event-sourced services with the minimal amount of code possible, but don't let its innocent appearance fool you; Booster analyzes the semantics of your code, sets up the optimal infrastructure to run your application at scale, and even generates a fully-working GraphQL API for you – don't even mind about writing the resolvers or maintaining your GraphQL schema, it will do that for you too."
"Booster is the fastest way to create an application in the cloud. It is a new kind of framework to build scalable and reliable systems easier, reimagining the software development experience to maximize your team’s speed and reduce friction on every level."
"Before Booster, building an event-driven system with the mentioned characteristics required huge investments in hiring engineers with the needed expertise. Booster packs this expertise, acquired from real-case scenarios in high-scale companies, into a very simple tool that handles with the hard parts for you, even provisioning the infrastructure!"
"Booster's ultimate goal is making developer's lives easier, fulfilling the dream of writing code in a domain-driven way that eases communications for the whole team, without caring about how anything else is done at the infrastructure level!"
"What does Booster boost? Your team’s productivity. Not just because it helps you work faster, but because it makes you worry about fewer buttons and switches. We aim to solve major productivity sinks for developers like designing the right cloud infrastructure, writing APIs or dealing with ORMs."
"Booster will fit like a glove in applications that are naturally event-driven like commerce applications (retail, e-commerce, omnichannel applications, warehouse management, etc.), business applications or communication systems, but it's a general-purpose framework that has several advantages over other solutions"
"Booster can deploy your application to a production-ready environment from minute one, without complicated configurations or needing to invest any effort to design it. In addition to that, it features a set of code generators to help developers build the project scaffolding faster and focus on actual business code in a matter of seconds instead of dealing with complicated framework folklore."
"Microservices are a great way to deal with code complexity, at least on paper. Services are isolated and can scale independently, and different teams can work independently, but that usually comes with a con: interfaces between services introduce huge challenges like delays, hard to solve cyclic dependencies, or deployment errors. In Booster, every handler function works as an independent microservice, it scales separately in its own lambda function, and there are no direct dependencies between them, all communication happens asynchronously via events, and all the infrastructure is compiled, type-checked and deployed atomically to avoid issues"
"Serverless technologies are amazing and have made a project like Booster possible, but they're relatively new technologies, and while day after day new tools appear to make them easier, the learning curve is still quite steep. With Booster you'll take advantage of Serverless’ main selling points of high scalability and reduced hosting costs, without having to learn every detail from minute one"
